# üß± Minecraft Mob Generator via Node-RED
This project integrates **Minecraft**, **Node-RED**, and **MQTT** to create a fully interactive web-based **Mob Generator** that changes an **LED Strip's** color based on the mob you spawned.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Node-RED Web Dashboard**:  
  User-friendly Mob Generator interface with buttons for each Minecraft mob type.

- **Minecraft Integration**:  
  Custom Node-RED nodes send commands to your Minecraft server (e.g., spawn mobs, eliminate players, fetch stats).

- **LED Feedback via MQTT**:  
  Each mob sends a color-coded MQTT message to control an RGB LED strip.

- **Modular Flow**:  
  Built for expandability‚Äîeasy to add new mobs, commands, or MQTT behaviors.

## üìù How to Use

### 1. Import the Node-RED Flow
- Download the JSON flow "Mob_Generator".
- Open **Node-RED**.
- Click on the **hamburger menu** (top right) ‚Üí **Import** ‚Üí **Clipboard**.
- Paste the JSON flow into the clipboard and click **Import**.
- The flow should now appear in your Node-RED workspace.

### 2. Set Up the MQTT Server
- In Node-RED, locate the MQTT nodes in the flow.

- Double-click on each MQTT node and configure the server:
  - Set the **MQTT Broker** to your own MQTT server (e.g., **IP address** or **hostname**).
  - Enter the **MQTT topic** you are using to control the LED strip (you may need to configure this in your MQTT broker).

### 3. Configure the Minecraft Server
- Locate the **RCON** nodes in the flow (for Minecraft integration).
- Double-click the RCON node and configure the Minecraft server:
  - Set the **RCON Host** to your Minecraft server‚Äôs **IP address**.
  - Set the **RCON Port** to your server‚Äôs RCON port (default is usually 25575).
  - Enter your **RCON Password** for authentication.

### 4. Access the Dashboard
- After importing the flow and configuring the servers, deploy the flow in Node-RED.
- Open a browser and navigate to your Node-RED dashboard (usually `http://<your-ip>:1880/ui`).
- You should now see the **Mob Generator Dashboard** with buttons to spawn mobs, trigger actions, and see the LED strip feedback.

Once everything is set up, you can interact with the dashboard, spawn mobs, and watch as the LED strip changes color based on the mob you spawn!
