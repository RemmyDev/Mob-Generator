🧱 Minecraft Mob Generator via Node-RED
-

This project integrates Minecraft, Node-RED, and MQTT to create a fully interactive web-based Mob Generator that changes an LED Strips color based on the mob you spawned
-

🚀 Features
- Node-RED Web Dashboard: User-friendly Mob Generator interface with buttons for each Minecraft mob type.
 
- Minecraft Integration: Custom Node-RED nodes send commands to your Minecraft server (e.g., spawn mobs, eliminate players, fetch stats).

- LED Feedback via MQTT: Each mob sends a color-coded MQTT message to control an RGB LED strip.
 
- Modular Flow: Built for expandability—easy to add new mobs, commands, or MQTT behaviors.
