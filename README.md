# üß± Minecraft Mob Generator via Node-RED
This project integrates **Minecraft**, **Node-RED**, and **MQTT** to create a fully interactive web-based **Mob Generator** that changes an **LED Strip's** color based on the mob you spawned.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Node-RED Web Dashboard**:  
  User-friendly Mob Generator interface with buttons for each Minecraft mob type.

- **Minecraft Integration**:  
  Custom Node-RED nodes send commands to your Minecraft server (e.g., spawn mobs, eliminate players, fetch stats).

- **LED Feedback via MQTT**:  
  Each mob sends a color-coded MQTT message to control an RGB LED strip.

- **Modular Flow**:  
  Easy to add new mobs, commands, or MQTT behaviors.

## üìù How to Use

### 1. Import the Node-RED Flow
- Download the JSON file "MobGeneratorFlow".
- Open **Node-RED**.
- Click on the **hamburger menu** (top right) ‚Üí **Import** ‚Üí **Clipboard**.
- Paste the JSON flow into the clipboard and click **Import**.
- The flow should now appear in your Node-RED workspace.

### 2. Set Up the MQTT Server
- In Node-RED, locate the MQTT nodes in the flow.
-  ![mqtt node](https://github.com/RemmyDev/Mob-Generator/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-14%20142115.png?raw=true)
- Double-click on each MQTT node and configure the server:
  - Set the **MQTT Broker** to your own MQTT server (e.g., **IP address** or **hostname**).
  - Enter the **MQTT topic** you are using to control the LED strip (you may need to configure this in your MQTT broker).

### 3. Configure the Minecraft Server
- Locate the **RCON** nodes in the flow (for Minecraft integration).
-  ![rcon node](https://github.com/RemmyDev/Mob-Generator/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-14%20142108.png?raw=true)
- Double-click the RCON node and configure the Minecraft server:
  - Set the **RCON Host** to your Minecraft server‚Äôs **IP address**.
  - Set the **RCON Port** to your server‚Äôs RCON port (default is usually 25575).
  - Enter your **RCON Password** for authentication.

### 4. Access the Dashboard
- After importing the flow and configuring the servers, deploy the flow in Node-RED.
- Open a browser and navigate to your Node-RED dashboard (usually `http://<your-ip>:1880/ui`), or click on the top right button with the square and arrow.
-  ![dashboard button](https://github.com/RemmyDev/Mob-Generator/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-14%20142057.png?raw=true)
- You should now see the **Mob Generator Dashboard** with buttons to spawn mobs, trigger actions, and see the LED strip feedback, as well as the mobs/commands working in minecraft!
- That's it, expand, change and do whatever you want with it.

### 5. Optional
üß™ Optional: LED Simulation

Want to test the LED logic without physical LEDs?

- Import the LEDSim flow the same way as above.

- Ensure it uses the same MQTT broker.

- You'll see simulated LED color changes based on the mob buttons:

### üîß Customize & Expand

- Add new mobs: duplicate a button node, change the mob name/command.

- Adjust LED colors: change the JS functions.

- Add new features using more Node-RED nodes.
